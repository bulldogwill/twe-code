# twe-code

This repository is a collection of functions, algorithms, and projects that I have worked on. 

##R Markdown Output

		PDFs created by R Markdown. 
		
##Functions

		kmeans.R --  I created my own k-means clustering algorithm from scratch in an effort to better understand the
		method, its limitations, and its intricacies. Anyone should be able to run the code in their console. A few 
		plots are produced as well; these require ggplot.
